    Remove save_config()
    
    This function was unused and the locking semantics it was using were
    unportable. I don't see a place for this feature, so I removed the function. If
    this is reimplemented it should be with fcntl.

    Added fixes for RPM packaging
    
    Updated SPEC file to be more useful and modified the autotools config to
    allow for seemless installation into fake root (again for RPM building).

    I need to keep track of this... why not put it here?

    Clarification of automake directives
    
    We shouldn't shotgun everything to CFLAGS. This breaks out preprocessor,
    compiler and linker flags to the right stages. It also clears the @STATIC@
    autoconf substitution properly.

    Allow spider to run from builddir and make dynamic linking the default
    
    There is really no reason for most users to install spider. I changed the
    paths searched for the config. and the default spider.conf path for SSNlin.xml
    to the $PWD. When spider is installed with make install sed replaces the path
    to SSNlin.xml in the spider.conf installed in @PREFIX@. This is a heavily
    requested feature here at the UA. I also made the default linking type dynamic
    because the user who is compiling the software doesn't care that it's static
    and static libs are rarely easy to come by in the zip,zzip -devel packages on
    most distros. When I'll add the --enable-static flag to the spec file
    (comming soon) so that we don't have to track deps using rpm.

    Fixed miraculous coincidence with sys/stat.h on x86/Linux
    
    Did you know that x86/x86_64 Linux glibc header sys/stat.h defined
    HAVE_SYS_STAT . I didn't, but I ran across a portability problem on
    PPC/Linux and discovered that I fat-fingered the SYS_STAT ifdefs .
    This also means that platforms that do not have sys/stat.h are
    broken. Will track down as time allows.

    Removed getpwuid() calls and clarified read_config()
    
    getpwuid() is problematic for portability and cannot be properly linked
    statically, whic remains the default. I removed these calls in favor of
    querying the environment for $HOME and $USER. This works well with sudo.
    I also fixed the value of ConfPath broken by my previous commit to
    respect the install prefix and spread out the nested if's as they were
    giving me a headache.
